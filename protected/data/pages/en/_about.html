<h3>Center for International Studies on Government</h3>
<p>The Center for International Studies on Government &nbsp;(CEGOV) located at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) develops studies and research projects on governmental affairs from a comparative perspective. The Center gathers researchers from several departments of the University, such as Economics, Political Science, Law, Administration, International Relations, Education, Urbanism and Computer Science. It emcompasses scholars from the most traditional research groups at UFRGS, &nbsp;specialized in a range of public policy areas, such as Health, Education, Sports, Public Security, Foreign Affairs and Defense.</p>
<p>CEGOV is chaired by a Director, and its policies and priorities are determined by an Advisory Board and a Scientific Board. The activities of the Center are undertaken by working groups, which take the responsibility for specific projects. Currently, CEGOV has eight fully established and operating working groups. The Center&rsquo;s researchers work on multidisciplinary projects covering the fields of international politics and governance, monitoring and evaluation of public policies, institutional development, Brazilian and South-American economy, comparative institutional design and decision-making processes, as well as public management, democratic controls and decentralization of public services. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Center is a place for interaction among scholars from UFRGS and other academic institutions, highlighting its multidisciplinary and open nature, as well as its vocation to collaborative applied research. Being a reference for research on comparative governmental studies, CEGOV offers a wide range of extracurricular activities such as extension and specialization courses (under- and graduate level), and advisory activities.</p>
