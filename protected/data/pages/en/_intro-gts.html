<h2>Working Groups</h2>
<p>CEGOV's Working Groups (WGs) are responsible for the development of research projects, teaching and extracurricular activities, fellowship opportunities, and agreements with public and private institutions. Each GT is formed from a proposal signed by three or more professors from UFRGS, linked to two or more Departments. Research, teaching and/or extracurricular activities are previously approved by the Scientific Board. The WGs can also be integrated by both professors and students from other institutions, public officials, and political leaders.</p>
